'''----------------  MAGIC / DUNDER METHODS  -------------------'''
'''These are special methods in python that have double underscores before and after them
They describe how particular methods should behave
Used to change or define how a method should behave inside a class'''

'''The __repr__ is the official representation of an object.
It is best to create in such a way that it tells a developer how to create a specific method
It is advicable to use f-strings
refer to Manager class


The __str__ representation is the opposite of the __repr__ representation.
It is a nice and informal representation of objects meant for user intead of developers
__str__ overridesthe __repr__
refer to Manager class'''

'''Uses of double and single underscores
Getters,  setters or property decorators'''
