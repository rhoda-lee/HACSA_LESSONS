Errors and Exceptions in Python
Types of errors and how to handle them.

Syntax Error:
This error happens due to incorrect code Syntax
Eg; incorrect spelling, unterminated string literal

Runtime Error:
Runtime errors are errors that occur during the execution of your program when something unexpected happens
When an error occurs which makes python unsure of what to do, this creates an exception object
We have to find a way of handling these errors and exceptions

Traceback:
The traceback is a report of the kind of error that happened

Error Handling
Try Except Error Handler:
Even if an exception happens the program keeps running.
Without this it will break the program
    Syntax
        try:
            what to run(contains code that may have an exception)
        except:
            code to catch the exception

Types of Exceptions
1. ZeroDivision Exception
This occurs when you try to divide a number by zero(0)

2. TypeError
It occurs when you attempt to perform an action of an incorrectÂ data type
Eg: 1 + '1' # concatenating a string and an integer

3. ValueError
Argument that has a specific type but it receives an inappropriate value

4. IndexError
