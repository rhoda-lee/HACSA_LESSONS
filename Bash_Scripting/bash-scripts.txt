Variiables are containers for data. They are also identifiers for data
They are available across all programming languages.

There are two types of variables.
1. System defined variables
2. User defined variables

System defined variables or environmental variables
    These are variables that come with the system
    eg: "$HOME", 
    "$SHELL", 
    "$PATH" It holds a list of directories in which the shell looks for executable files whenever a command is run
    "$USER" It stores the name of the current user
    "$PWD" This prints the current working directory
    "$OLDPWD" Stores the previous working directory
    "$LANG" Shows current language being used
    "$LOGNAME"
    "$HOSTNAME" This shows the name of the laptop
To see all system variables use command: 
printenv

These kind of variables can be temp modified but the changes apply only to the current shell session. 
Upon killing the terminal, changes will be lost.
use command: export the-variable new-data
eg: export NAME="Michaela"
    echo $NAME


User defined variable or local variable
    These are variables defined or creted by the user to store data.
    Syntax: variable_name=value
    eg: name="Rhoda Lee"

I added a script called variable.sh" in the Bsh_Scripting folder.
This script when run, creates a variable called name, assigns it with a value 
and prints it to the terminal with a message

#!/bin/bash

name="Rhoda Lee"
program="Tech4Girls"
region="Greater Accra Region"
hobby="read and write"
num_of_siblings=3
laptop_name=$NAME

echo " Hello my name is $name! Nice to meet you
I am a $program scholar and I live in a town in the $region. 
I love to $hobby when I am at home. I have $num_of_siblings other siblings. The name of my laptop is $laptop_name"



ARITHMETICS IN BASH
Syntax:
$((n1 + n2))
ie; variable_name=$((n1 + n2))

#!/bin/bash

# Syntax: $((n1 + n2))

sum=$((7+8))
echo "The sum of 7 and 8 is: $sum"

# Also, you can use:
a=10
echo "a is $a"
b=2
echo "b is $b"

addition=$((a+b))
echo "Sum of a and b: $addition"

# Subtraction
difference=$((a-b))
echo "Difference of a and b: $difference"

# Division
division=$((a/b))
echo "a divided by b: $division"

# Multiplication
multiple=$((a*b))
echo "a multiplied by b: $multiple"

# Modulos
c=10
echo "c is $c"
d=3
echo "d is $d"

modulos=$((c%d))
echo "c modulos d: $modulos"

# For multiplication use: "*"
# For division use: "/"
# For modulos use: "%"
# For exponentiation or power use: "**"

THE READ COMMAND
It is used to read user input from the terminal
read command

eg:

echo "What is your name? "
read name

echo "Hello $name"

"-p" is used to read from multiple lines
eg:
read -p "Enter your firstname and lastname" firstname lastname
echo $firstname
echo $lastname

## Positional arguments in Bash Bash_Scripting
Positional arguments allow input values from the from the CLI 
$0 - script's name or first argument
$1 - second argument
$2 - third argument

echo "Hello $0

LOGICAL OPERATORS
Logical OR = || or -o
Logical AND = && or -a
Logical NOT = !

CONTROL FLOW
If statement
An if statement is used to eveluate a condition and decide on what action to take when that condition happens.

SYNTAX
if [ condition]
    then
        statement
fi

LOOPS IN BASH
They are used to execute a list of commands repeatedly until a certain condition is met

WHILE LOOPS
while [ condition ]
do
    [ command ]
    [ command ]
    [ command ]
done
