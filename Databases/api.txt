CREATING AN API 
API Endpoints

Frameworks
A framework is a Prewritten code that provides a structure and common functionalities for building applications
They provide reusable components, tools and libraries whixh can speed up development 
and ensure consistency accross projects

Flask is a ligtweight and flexible web Frameworks for python 
It is designed to be simple and easy to use making it a popular choice 
for small to medium size applications or apis

It is often refered to as a micro framework because it provides the 
essential tools to get a web appliication running


Benefits of Flask
1. Flask provides the core features needed for web dev without imposing a specific projct structure

2. It is extensible:
    Dev can add extensions to handle tasks such as database integration and authentication

3. It can be used to render HTML templates: Can be used for both frontend and backend development

4. Provides a simple way to map URLs to python functionalities

5. Provides a built-in server for development and debugging


In Flask a route in an endpoint


(myenv) rhodalee@Rhoda-Lee:~/HACSA_LESSONS/Databases/sql_alchemy$ python3 app.py
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

127.0.0.1 - - [27/Nov/2024 16:12:06] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -

FLASK_APP (Flask Environmental variable)
Tells flask the file my lask app is in
The environmental variable are only bound to the terminal session that is active or you are in

export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

(myenv) rhodalee@Rhoda-Lee:~/HACSA_LESSONS/Databases/sql_alchemy$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
(myenv) rhodalee@Rhoda-Lee:~/HACSA_LESSONS/Databases/sql_alchemy$ flask run
 * Serving Flask app 'app.py'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit


Debug Mode:
It automatically saves what we are doing
This reflects changes we make in our app on the server
Run with python3 app.py

If you want to use FLASK_APP, then use an environmental variable
export FLASK_BUG=1, WHERE 1 is True and 0 functionalities
flask run



Blueprints in flask are ways to organize your apps into smaller reusable components.
They allow you to split your app into modules
Each Blueprint can have its own routes, templates, static file and other resources
