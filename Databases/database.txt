DATABASES

A Database is a structured or unstructured collection of data that the backend server uses to store and manage informatio efficiently
A  database can be accessed by the backend code to retrieve, update, delete data

Importance of Databases in backend development
1. To store data persistently even after the application closes or the server restarts
2. To organize and manage data for easy accessed
3. To handle large amount of data that cannot fit in memory
4. To allow multiple users to access the same data simultaneously

Databases are very important for frontend and backend development in web architecture
There are 2 types of DBMS
1. Relational
They handle databases by storing them in tables
The columns in the table has fields
They are relatively harder to learn as compared to non-relational databases
    i. MySQL
    ii. PostgreSqL
    iii. SQLite

2. Non-Relational DBMS
Data is stored as documents, key-value pairs or graphs
They are recommended or used for large unstructured data that cannot fit in tables
    i. MongoDB
    ii. CassandraDB
    iii. Redis


MySQL
It is a query language
We are using local SQL
Syntax

    Creating a database
    ```bash
    CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    eg:
    CREATE DATABASE tech4girls;

    Output:
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
    ```

    Showing a database
    ```bash
    SHOW DATABASES;

    Output:
    mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | mysql              |
    | performance_schema |
    | sys                |
    | tech4girls         |
    +--------------------+
    5 rows in set (0.04 sec)

    ```

    Using a Database
    ```bash
    USE tech4girls;

    Output:
    Database changed
    ```

    Interracting with SQL server using Scripts
    SQL Scripting

    Deleting a database
    ```bash
    DROP DATABASE tech4girls;
    ```


    Making sql script executable
    run this after chmod +x test.sql
    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p < test.sql
    ```

-- Creatig a Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tech4girls;   -- Use this instead when creating a Database
Using IF in SQL

SQL executes from the top
A database of everyone in class


DATA TYPES IN SQL
1. VARCHAR(256) -- takes in an argument of a specific number which is how long it can be

2. INT -- Used to store positive and negative whole numbers

3. FLOAT -- Used for numbers with fractional part

4. DATE 

5. BOOLEAN -- For True or False Values

CONSTRAINTS
Used to set limitations and restictions applied to a specific column 
to make sure wrong data is not inserted in the table

1. NOT NULL
This makes sure column value in every row is not empty or blank

2. UNIQUE
Column values in every row is unique

3. PRIMARY KEY
A combination of the UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints 
They are usually set to be IDs since they are mostly unique 
For every table there must be only one property set as PRIMARY key

4. FOREIGN KEY
Used to form relationships between tables
It helps to create parent child relationships between tables

5. AUTO_INCREMENT
This increments any column value automatically




Creating tables
``bash
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS backend_class(
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(256) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(256) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
);

```

Showing a table
```bash
SHOW TABLES;
```

PREVILEGES
They are permissions granted to users or roles that define what actions they can perform 
on databases, tables or other objects in a Database Management System.

TYPES OF PREVILEGES
- Object Level Priviledge
    SELECT
    INSERT 
    UPDATE
    
- Database Level Priviledge
    CREATE
    DROP
    ALL - For granting all priviledges 

- Administrative Level Priviledge
    GRANT   ------------- SHOW GRANTS FOR 'root'@'localhost'; ---------
    RELOAD
    SUPER

ROOT USER (DEFAULT USER)
Has all priviledges. Meaning they have the power to control all SQL.
- Reading, writing, modifying or managing the database itself

-- CREATING A USER IN SQL --
```bash
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
```

-- ENTERING MYSQL INTERPRETER AS A NEW USER, NOT ROOT --
```bash
rhodalee@Rhoda-Lee:~/HACSA_LESSONS$ mysql -u rhodalee -p
```

-- GRANTING PRIVILEDGES --
SYNTAX:
```bash
GRANT privilege_type ON database.table_name TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
This is done or granted by the root user.

-- GRANTING PRIVILEDGES --
```bash
GRANT privilege_type ON database.table_name TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
-- USAGE
```bash
GRANT SELECT ON tech4girl.backend_class TO 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

-- GRANTING A PRIVILEGE ON ALL DATABASES THE ROOT USER OWNS TO ANOTHER USER
```bash
GRANT privilege_type ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost';
```
-- USAGE
```bash
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT ON *.* TO 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

-- REMOVING PRIVELEGES FROM USERS
```bash
REVOKE privilege_type ON database.table_name FROM 'username'@'localhost';
```
-- USAGE
```bash
REVOKE INSERT ON tech4girls.backend_class FROM 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

-- REMOVING A PRIVILEGE ON ALL DATABASES THE ROOT USER GAVE TO ANOTHER USER
```bash
REVOKE privilege_type ON *.* FROM 'username'@'localhost';
```
-- USAGE
```bash
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT ON *.* FROM 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

-- MAKING ONE A ROOT USER, GIVE ALL PRIVILEGES
```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

-- REVOKING ALL PRIVILEGES FROM A USER
```bash
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM 'rhodalee'@'localhost';
```

                     --------- RELATIONSHIPS IN SQL -------------
All types of datbases have relationships.
Relationships define how tables are connected.
They ensure proper structuring or Relational Databases and data consistency.
There are 3 types of relationships:

ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIP (1 ---> 1 )
Each row in Table A is linked exactly to one(1) row in Table B
    Eg: Users having one profile and each profile belonging to one user
    They are linked together by a user ID

    Eg: Each student uses one laptop and each laptop is used by one user


ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP (1 ---> *(Many))
A row in table A can be related to many rows in Table B but 
one row in Table B can only relate to one row intable A.
    Eg: Customers can place many orders but one order is linked to one customer.



MANY-MANY RELATIONSHIP (*(Many) ---> *(Many))
